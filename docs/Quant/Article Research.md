# Recent Progress
- **Moving Average Distance (MAD) Strategies**: Researchers like Avramov, Kaplanski, and Subrahmanyam explored the distance between short- and long-run moving averages as a predictor for equity returns. Their findings revealed that the MAD effect is robust across various market conditions and provides additional explanatory power beyond traditional momentum strategies. The behavioral underpinnings suggest that investor anchoring to long-term averages causes underreaction to new information, creating profitable trends​

- **Optimization of Trend Speeds**: Studies have examined the impact of trend speeds on portfolio performance. For example, the Man Group found that faster trend-following models provide stronger "crisis alpha" by mitigating drawdowns during market downturns. However, faster strategies are more sensitive to transaction costs. A diversified approach combining different trend speeds has been proposed to balance returns and risk-mitigation properties​

- **Integration with Portfolio Construction**: Recent research has focused on combining trend-following strategies with traditional portfolios (e.g., 60/40 equity-bond allocations). These studies demonstrate that trend-following strategies, especially those with diversified speeds, enhance defensive portfolio characteristics by reducing drawdowns and improving risk-adjusted returns​

- **Behavioral and Execution Considerations**: New studies also address the role of investor psychology and execution efficiency in the success of trend-following strategies. Efficient trading execution, such as algorithmic trade management, reduces the impact of high-frequency trading competition and optimizes cost management​
